# Collections

TanStack DB collections. Big picture in docs/state.md; contracts (writeUpsert, mutation handlers, live queries, pagination) in docs/tanstack.md — this file is only the local gotchas those don't cover.

Three kinds live here: server-backed via `queryCollectionOptions` (channels, tracks, follows, tags — channels.ts/tracks.ts are the canonical examples), local-only via `createLocalCollection` (capture-events, spam-decisions, track-meta, views), and one subscription-only realtime collection, broadcasts.ts (no mutation handlers; drives `deck.broadcasting_channel_id` as a side effect).

Gotchas:

- Every queryFn and handler branches on `capabilities.globalBrowse` / `capabilities.mutations` (`$lib/modes`) — embed/standalone mode vs the full app. Easy to break.
- `writeUpsert` accepts a single item or an array. `writeBatch` is only needed to mix operation types (insert + delete) in one atomic batch.
