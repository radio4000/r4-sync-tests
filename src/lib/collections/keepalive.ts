 * ephemeral Discogs tracks, queues spread over too many channels, and queues whose
 * channels we can't yet name — all short, or rare, or both.
 *
 * A queue's channels are only trusted when the deck's view names them, or when every
 * row is loaded and can say which channel it belongs to. Guessing from a half-loaded
 * queue would shrink the pin, evict the rest, and shrink it again.
 *
 * Pass a snapshot read as getTrack (`collection.get`), deliberately non-reactive to
 * row loads: a half-loaded queue stays on the id pin until the deck next churns.
 * Over-pins, never under-pins — don't "fix" it into a live query.
