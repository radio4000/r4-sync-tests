# Decks player UI

## Terms

| Term                      | What                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Deck` (type)             | State object: playback + queue + layout config. Lives in `appState.decks[id]`.                                                                                                                                                                      |
| `deck.ts`                 | Pure helpers to query decks: find by channel/slug, check playing/broadcasting/listening state.                                                                                                                                                      |
| `deck.svelte`             | Component that renders a `Deck`. Wraps `player.svelte` + `queue-panel.svelte`.                                                                                                                                                                      |
| `deck-compact-bar.svelte` | Compact renderer for a `Deck` (like `deck.svelte`, but a thin bar). Does not own a media element — controls the hidden `deck.svelte`'s via `getMediaPlayer(deckId)`, and reads progress from mirrored `deck.media_current_time` / `media_duration`. |
| `player.svelte`           | Media UI inside `deck.svelte`: header, video embed, transport controls. Renders one media element at a time (`<youtube-video>`, `<soundcloud-player>`, or `<audio>`).                                                                               |
| `queue-panel.svelte`      | Queue/history sidebar, injected into `player.svelte` as a children snippet.                                                                                                                                                                         |

`deck-strip.svelte` loops all decks, splitting them into local and broadcast-listening groups. `+layout.svelte` separately loops compact deck IDs into `deck-compact-bar.svelte` at the layout bottom.

## `deck.clock` — who drives the playhead

A deck's playhead is driven by exactly one source. `deck.clock` is a tagged union storing that identity:

- absent — `manual`: you control it
- `{kind: 'mirror', channel}` — mirrors a broadcaster's live stream (see [broadcast](broadcast.md))
- `{kind: 'auto', rotationStart}` — the auto-radio formula drives it (see [auto-radio](auto-radio.md))

`mirror` and `auto` on one deck is unrepresentable — a deck is only ever one. `deck.drifted` is the single flag (computed in `player.svelte`) for "this mirror/auto deck deviated from its clock". Read clock identity through the helpers in `player/clock.ts` (`clockKind`, `isMirroring`, `mirroredChannelId`, `isAutoRadio`, `autoRotationStart`) rather than poking `deck.clock.kind`.

## Display derivation

`player.svelte` and `deck-compact-bar.svelte` both need "what track/channel is this deck showing". `createDeckDisplay(getDeckId)` (`player/deck-display.svelte.ts`) is the one reactive source: it centralises the `track ?? broadcastTrack ?? lastTrack` fallback, the `channel ?? lastChannel` fallback, and the mirror-header rule (`headerChannel`/`secondaryHeaderChannel`). Pass a `getDeckId` getter so it stays reactive when the deck id changes.

## `Deck` layout flags

Four booleans on the `Deck` type. `compact`/`expanded` are mutually exclusive. The other two are independent.

- `compact` — the `Deck` is rendered twice: `deck.svelte` in the strip shrinks to `width:0` (stays in DOM for audio), and `deck-compact-bar.svelte` appears at the layout bottom as the visible UI.
- `expanded` — `deck.svelte` goes `position:fixed; inset:0`. LayoutHeader hides. Force-clears `hide_video_player`.
- `hide_video_player` — video collapses to 0x0 via CSS. Audio keeps playing.
- `hide_queue_panel` — `display:none` on queue panel. Video fills freed space.

Deck ID 1 (the default) is hidden until it has queued tracks or an active track. Additional decks are always visible once created.

## Mobile layout behavior

- With multiple non-compact decks, the deck strip splits available height between them.
- On small screens with multiple non-compact decks, the main page content area is capped so decks can use most of the viewport height.
- Compact decks still render their hidden `deck.svelte` instance (for audio continuity), but collapse to zero height in the mobile strip.
- Visible compact controls live in the bottom compact section (`deck-compact-bar.svelte` in `+layout.svelte`).
- On compact decks, mobile view prioritizes channel micro cards (horizontal scroll, truncated slugs) and hides track row to keep controls usable.
