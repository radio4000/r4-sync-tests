# The R4 universe in three layers

WHAT EXISTS → Channel, Track, Meta
WHAT YOU DO WITH IT → View, Play
WHAT HAPPENS LIVE → Deck, Broadcast, Auto-radio

## Layer 1: what exists

Channel → Track(URL) → Meta

A channel is whoever you want to be — a name, a taste made persistent, a growing list of references. A track is a pointer with opinions: "this thing lives at this URL, I call it this, I'd tag it #dub." You never host the media. You reference and annotate. Meta is what other systems know about that pointer — duration from YouTube, artist from MusicBrainz, pressing year from Discogs. It helps; it does not define your taste.

## Layer 2: what you do with it

Search → View → Tracks → Queue

A search is a view that hasn't been named yet. A saved view is a search that earned a name. A pinned view earned a place in the navigation. Each is the same shape — a query (@oskar #jazz miles) that filters, sorts, and narrows tracks into a queue. Four jobs, one shape. The difference is just how long you want to keep it.

## Layer 3: what happens now

Queue → Deck → Sound

A deck performs a queue. Broadcast shares that deck in real time — same track, same second, across whoever is listening. Auto-radio is the same shared timeline without a broadcaster.

## The whole picture

How filtered tracks become playback:

```
  Filtered tracks
       │
       ├─ playChannel ────→ set full queue, play first
       ├─ playFromHere ───→ set queue from this track onward
       ├─ shufflePlay ────→ random start + shuffle queue
       ├─ joinAutoRadio ──→ deterministic live radio (see layer 3)
       │
       └─ addToPlaylist / playNext ──→ append or insert into existing queue
```

## Capture events

```
  playTrack(deckId, trackId, reason_start)
       │
       ├──→ capture('player:track_play', {track_id, play_id, reason_start, ...})
       │
       ···track plays···
       │
       └──→ capture('player:track_end', {play_id, ms_played, end_reason, ...})

  Reasons capture the edges between player states:
    start: user click, next/prev, auto_next, play_channel, broadcast_sync, track_error
    end:   track_completed, user stop, next/prev, playlist_change, broadcast_sync, error
```

## Layer 3: what happens live

```

              │
              ├── play / pause / seek
              │
              ├── Broadcast (live DJ)
              │     DJ side:       startBroadcast → deck state → remote row
              │     Remote:        realtime subscription pushes changes
              │     Listener side: joinBroadcast → mirror deck state → player
              │                    leaveBroadcast → stop mirroring
              │     Drift:         mirror deck seeks/skips → deck.drifted
              │
              └── Auto-radio (no DJ)
                    tracks → toAutoTracks (need duration)
                           → epochFromTracks (oldest created_at)
                           → weeklyShuffle (seeded by epoch + week + view)
                           → playbackState (elapsed % total duration)
                           → same track, same second, every client
                    Drift: user deviates → auto_radio_drifted → resync button
                    View:  deck stores the view → different filters = different shuffle
```

## Deck state (grouped)

```
  Deck
    playlist:   what's queued, what's playing
    playback:   playing, volume, speed, shuffle
    layout:     compact | expanded, video visible, queue panel visible
    broadcast:  which channel this deck is broadcasting
    listening:  which broadcast this deck is tuned to, drift state
    auto-radio: active, drifted, rotation epoch, view (for resync + seed)
```
