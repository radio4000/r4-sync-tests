# Code style

## Writing style

For voice and tone across all copy (UI, docs, changelog), see [tone.md](tone.md).

Lead with the point. Skip preambles, start mid-thought when context is clear.

Assume domain knowledge. Say "use debouncing" not "you might want to consider implementing a debouncing mechanism." Reference concepts directly without basic explanations.

Natural prose over formatting tricks. Never do "**bold**: explanation" syntax. Prefer flowing paragraphs to numbered lists when the content permits. Sentence case for titles.

Terse and precise. Expand reasoning only when asked. Point out flaws directly: "that breaks because..." not "one consideration might be..."

Dry wit welcome. Channel the sensibility of someone who finds elegance in plain text and thinks most abstractions are premature.

## Code conventions

- Minimal abstraction - direct property access, no unnecessary layers
- A `$derived` earns its name when it describes state (`isMirroring`, `isBroadcasting`) or combines values. One that renames a property or prepends `/` and is used once is noise — inline it
- Self-documenting code via clear naming; comments only explain WHY when not obvious
- Named exports over default exports
- JSDoc for types, don't obsess over TypeScript
- Compose from domain primitives (deck, channel, track) — don't pre-digest into intermediate shapes
- Derive display values where they're used, not in builder functions upstream
- Domain-specific verbs that match user mental models
- Pure functions for composability in api/utils/data operations
- Optimistic execution - trust methods, let errors throw
- No type casts to silence errors - they hide real issues
- No i18n until features are finalized

## HTML/CSS

Global styles in `styles/style.css`, custom properties in `variables.css`. Don't redefine what's already there.

Semantic elements (`<section>`, `<article>`, `<figure>`) over `<div>`s. No classes by default — use structure, ARIA roles, `data-*` attributes, and modern selectors (`:has`, `:where`, `:is`). Only add a class for 3rd-party hooks or proven reuse.

Trust global defaults for spacing and typography. Only write CSS for functionality. Reuse from `layout.css`.

## Svelte 5

Use `$derived` liberally - values can be reassigned and object properties mutated.

`await` works inside `<script>`, `$derived()`, and markup.
