# PLAN

Possible improvements. Roughly by priority. Verify before implementing.

See CHANGELOG.md for user-facing history.

## UI cleanup — mobile-first (in progress)

**Problem:** channel pages feel ~80% tappable (409 interactives on `@ko002` mobile). Compact deck and header are cramped and inconsistent.

**Workflow:** plan with Oskar → Sonnet implements → Fable-high reviews → iterate. Test channel: `@ko002`.

### Design principles (draft — Oskar to tweak)

1. One primary action per zone.
2. Static-by-default — tags/metadata earn a tap only when browsing is the intent.
3. Consistent deck — same control positions across play states; icons change, layout doesn't.
4. Progressive disclosure — secondary controls behind one overflow, not a scrolling icon row.
5. Mobile budget — deck bar: ≤4 always-visible transport controls + one overflow.

## Backlog

- `userHasPlayed` not reset between playlists (`player.svelte`) — flag carries over when switching channels, may cause unexpected autoplay. Needs verification and user testing.

## One day

- Test RTL support
- `TrackCard` parses `track.description` with LinkEntities on every render. Consider a DB trigger or cache.
- Media Session API — lock screen and notification controls (play/pause/skip/artwork). Needs research: YouTube/SoundCloud iframes set their own `mediaSession`, may conflict. Our next/prev/seek would work (we proxy via iframe APIs), but play/pause and metadata could fight the iframe.
- Duplicate track detection — warn when adding a URL that already exists in the channel. Could also surface in batch-edit (group by URL or `media_id`).
- Musicbrainz/discogs auto-matching has a high error rate. Let users mark metadata as wrong, or show an "unverified" badge.
- `src/lib/metadata/discogs-core.js` — in-memory fetch cache grows unbounded. 5-min TTL but no eviction. Long sessions accumulate entries. Could move to a db collection.
- Play history threshold: a track is recorded the moment it starts playing. Should count only after enough listening: full track if under 2 min, half the duration (max 4 min) otherwise. Open questions: accumulate actual play time vs. furthest position? What about pause/resume? Should skipped tracks get a `skipped` flag or disappear? Currently `capture('player:track_play')` fires in `playTrack()` (api.ts); would move to `player.svelte` using `timeupdate`. Needs `getPlayCountThreshold(durationSec)` helper and a way to pass `reason_start` to the player.

## Needs research

- Views beyond tracks — Views are currently tracks-centric: `ViewSource` describes track filters (`channels`, `tags`, `search`), `queryView` returns tracks, `processViewTracks` sorts/filters tracks. Explore whether Views could describe channels or mixed results too (e.g. `searchChannelsCombined` already runs parallel to `queryView` on search pages). Questions: would a `ViewResult` with `{tracks, channels}` simplify search pages further, or would it over-abstract a simple parallel call? Would saved views benefit from storing channel results? Is the current split (Views = tracks, channel search = separate) actually the clearest pattern? May conclude the current design is right and the abstraction isn't worth it.
- `fetchQuery` usage review — remaining: `[slug]/tracks/[tid]/(tabs)/related` still calls `queryClient.fetchQuery` in the component body (followers/following pages now go through `getChannelConnections`).
- atproto scrobbling — on play, write `fm.teal.alpha.feed.play` to the user's PDS via teal.fm's lexicon. Shared listening history across apps. Requires OAuth account linking, opt-in, one `createRecord` per play. Fire-and-forget, no sync. Proves out atproto OAuth plumbing for everything else.
- atproto as backend — sign in with Bluesky, sync channels/tracks. Major architectural shift. See github.com/radio4000/r4atproto
- Shared track_meta — collaborative metadata curation between users. See github.com/radio4000/r4-sync-tests/issues/6
- Hashtag parsing — should `"#one#two"` be one tag or two? Follow Twitter/Bluesky convention. Decide, update LinkEntities test and regexes. Parsing happens in Postgres, not the app — tests should use the same regexes. Same question applies to `parseQuery` in `views.ts`. Tokenizer splits on whitespace only.
